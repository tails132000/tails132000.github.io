        <h1>Illu's New Life</h1> I would like to take this chance to practice writing html and write an adoption journal for Illu, my new dog.

    <p>
        <H3>July 17, 2016</H3> Today our family adopted a dog from the animal shelter.

        <br> I named her Illu, as illumination. I hope she will bring lights and sparks into our life.
        <H3>July 29, 2016</H3> Today Illu showed her little devil inside her. When we got back from lunch, all we could see were blankets and plastic bags all over the place, while she greeted us with her innocence. It is really no use to blame the dog if you don't catch it commiting crime right on the spot. We are considering buying an appropriate cage for her.

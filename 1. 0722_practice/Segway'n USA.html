Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: 
<ol>
<li>Walla Walla, WA, </li>
<li>Magic City, ID, </li>
<li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
<li>Last Chance, CO, </li>
<li>Truth or Consequences, NM, </li>
<li>Why, AZ </li>
</ol>

I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<blockquote>
"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<h3>June 2, 2012</h3><br>
My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul>
<li>cellphone, </li>
<li>iPod, </li>
<li>digital camera </li>
<li>protein bar </li>
</ul>
<br>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
